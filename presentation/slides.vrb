To answer "How significant is our dicovery based on such dataset?"
\begin{exampleblock}{Permutation Analysis}
\textbf{Step 1} Shuffling the samples' label (not replicates' label)\\
\textbf{Step 2} Measure generalization error\\
\textbf{Repeat 1 and 2}\\
\textbf{Then} Get a distribution of generalization error\\
P-value can be estimated as the frequency that error rate is smaller than the one computed from true labeling
\end{exampleblock}
